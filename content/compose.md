# Music Production

Music Production is for high school students to compose and record a song. Successfully completing this 8 week course earns 0.5 credits in Fine and Applied Arts. We meet virtually for 3 hours per week. Bravery is more important than musical talent. The goal is to experience the process more than the production of excellence. Courses are taught by a state endorsed music teacher.

Each phase stands independently. For example, a student who already has a song recorded (phase 2), may opt for only the third phase, to make the song into a music video. Or, also acceptable, is a student who only wants to compose a song (phase 1), but is not interested in making a music video. However, this ambitious course requires 3 hours of online meetings each week and approximately 5 hours of weekly homework in order to finish the product on schedule.

Doing all three phases will earn a 0.5 credit in the category of “Fine and Applied Arts”. To complete the assignments, students are expected to have a smart phone, laptop, internet connection, and any musical instrument.

On June 21, our first session, registered students will follow a link to an online meeting. Students will be introduced to the course scope, sequence, and assignemnts. Exact days and times for the summer schedule will be negotiated with the majority of classmates.
