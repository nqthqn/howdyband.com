# Music Production

Music Production is for high school students to compose and record a song. Successfully completing this 6 week course earns 0.5 credits in Fine and Applied Arts. Bravery is more important than musical talent. Middle school students must audition for available seats. Visit

HowdyBand.com/compose/

**Summer Term Schedule**

Song Composition: Session 1: June 13 - July 1

Record a Song: Session 2: July 2 - July 22

Students need not have musical talent, only bravery. Each session stands independently. For example, a student who already has a song recorded, may opt for only the second session, to make the song into a music video. Or, also acceptable, is a student who only wants to compose a song, but is not interested in making a music video.

The goal is to experience the process more than the production of excellence. Courses are taught by a state endorsed music teacher.

This ambitious class requires 3 hours of online meetings each week and approximately 5 hours of weekly homework in order to finish the product on schedule.

Doing so will earn a 0.5 credit in the category of “Fine and Applied Arts”. To complete the assignments, students are expected to have a smart phone, laptop, internet connection, and any musical instrument.

  
Exact days and times to be negotiated with the majority of classmates.
